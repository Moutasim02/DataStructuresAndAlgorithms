# Selection Sort
**Complexity:<br>
Worst case = O(n^2)<br>
Best case = O(n^2)**
<br><br>
**Stable? No**
<br><br>
**Use case:** It performs well on small lists/ arrays.

### Methodology
- Find maximum item in the whole item
- Swap it with the last element
- Next loop, Find max item in the remaining array while ignoring last element (already in right position)
